If you were to boil down a site like Facebook to its most basic elements, you would find a header, two sidebars, a content area, and a footer. When you create a website, you need a way to seperate page elements. The best way to do this is using HTML.

Tags
Everything in HTML is defined with tags, surrounded with < >. For example, when starting an HTML document, you use the opening tag <html>. To close an HTML document, you use </html>.

Divs
A div is, in its simplest form, an imaginary box to contain content in an HTML document. The div tag is very simple, it looks like this: <div>your content here</div>. When you begin to get a larger document, it becomes important to identify your elements, especially divs. Instead of opening a div with a simple <div> you can append id="divname". For example, if you were working on the site's header, you might use <div id="header"></div>. Identifying HTML elements also becomes important when using CSS, which we'll learn later.

Try It
Now that you know about divs and identifying them, try to build a simple structure of a FaceBook like site. Be sure to include the header, content area, sidebars, and footer.

<div id="header">
	
</div>
<div id="sidenav">
	
</div>
<div id="content">

</div>
<div id="sideads">

</div>
<div id="footer">

</div>

Creating a Full HTML Document
Before we proceed, it is important to know that the above does not constitute a well written HTML document. You'll need to add items to the beginning and end of the document. First, add <!DOCTYPE HTML>, this tells the browser that it should render an HTML document from what you've created. Next, add the <html> and <body> tags. At the end of the document, close both tags respectively. You should end up with:
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
	<body>
		<div id="header">
			
		</div>
		<div id="sidenav">
			
		</div>
		<div id="content">
			
		</div>
		<div id="sideads">
			
		</div>
		<div id="footer">
			
		</div>
	</body>
</html>

Additional Tags
HTML is made up of thousands of tags, but a few important ones that we'll be using today include headings, paragraphs, lists, head tags, title, and more.

Title
We want to give our page a title. To do this, we must create a <head> section between the <html> and <body>. Within that section, we should place a title tag: <title>Title of Page</title>

Text
In HTML, there are six headings ranging from <h1> to <h6>. Each heading gets smaller or larger respectively. When writing standard, non-heading, text, use the <p>, or paragraph tag. If you want to create a new line, you'll have to use a special tag called a <br />.

Lists
Lists become very important in HTML. In fact, lists are used in places you would not expect, like the navigation bar of Facebook.
