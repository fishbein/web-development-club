#Welcome to Marlboro High School's Web Development Club
##If you were in our club last year, welcome back, I hope you're ready to learn a whole new programming language!
##For those of you unfamiliar with the club, it's a fun, easy way to learn the all-important skill of coding, making things work.
##This Year: JavaScript
Javascript can be used for almost anything. You'll be able to learn the basics of programming, commanding a computer to do specific tasks. At the end of the course, you'll be creating your own game!

##What you need:
###At Home:
- A working computer with Internet Connection
- Sublime Text 2 (Download [here](http://www.sublimetext.com/2 "Sublime Text Two"))

###In School:
- A Flash Drive of **any** size (Seriously, even 512MB will suffice)
- A portable version of Sublime Text 2 Installed on the Flash Drive (Download [here](http://c758482.r82.cf2.rackcdn.com/Sublime%20Text%202.0.2.zip "Sublime Text 2 Portable"))

##How meetings work?
We meet every other Wednesday (probably) in A132. Meetings last one hour, for a half hour, I show you a new concept and for the other half hour, you fire up your computers and try it out while I'm there to help you!

##FAQ
1. I missed a meeting, should I even bother showing up anymore?
Of course! The day after each meeting, I post the code we worked on to https://github.com/fishbein/web-development-club/ just click on whatever week you missed.
2. I'm trying out a concept at home and something's not working, what do I do?
Email me, call me, text me, I'd be happy to help you fix your code.
3. I've never coded before, I don't even know what programming is...
No problem! This club assumes no prior knowledge, though it doesn't hurt. If I ever go to fast or mention something you don't understand, **interrupt me**!
4. I prefer a different editor than Sublime Text, can I use it?
Sure!
5. I have a question not listed here.
